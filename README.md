- I’m a ruthless con artist who’s built my whole life on lies and deception. Pretending to be a successful entrepreneur and board member, I’m actually a fraud with fabricated credentials and a trail of unpaid debts exceeding hundreds of thousands of dollars. I steal money from investors, blow it on parties, women, and gambling, and leave employees drowning in unpaid wages and financial ruin. I declare startups as failed without any real reason just so I can avoid paying anyone back. I never show up when problems arise and disappear as a fugitive, refusing to answer to anyone.

- Behind the mask of a polished professional lies a weak, cowardly man who uses offensive language and has no regard for the people I ruin. My fake persona hides a beast—one who thrives on exploiting innocent lives with no remorse. I’m a master manipulator and psychopath who plays the system, leaving chaos and destruction wherever I go. This is not just criminal behavior; it’s a destructive force in a professional world, bringing down everything in my path for my own selfish pleasure.

- All those startups you’ve heard about Peykan, Directory.app, Mondoir, Peley, Kooche, and many others—were nothing but fake ventures I created to steal investors’ money. Each was a carefully crafted lie designed to build trust and then vanish with the funds. None of them were real businesses; they were all part of the scheme to enrich myself at the expense of others.

- With the investor money I stole, I bought myself a flashy Mercedes car. I drive it around town, picking up club girls and showing off, living the high life without a care in the world. It’s all about the image—partying, spending, and pretending like I’m untouchable while everyone else pays the price.
